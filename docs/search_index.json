Please make sure that the following libraries are installed: deSolve for integration of differential equations tidyverse for data manipulation and plotting knitr to compile this document igraph for visualizing networks Questions and answers If you have a question that prevents you from following the lecture, please unmute yourself and ask the questionâ€”other students are likely to have the same problem! If you are asking a question out of curiosity, or that can be discussed later, please put it in the chat. I will keep the last few minutes of each lecture for Q&amp;A. "]
